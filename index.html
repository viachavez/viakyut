    <h1>Halluuuuu my Future Engineer!</h1>

    <p>On this beautiful day, I wanted to take a moment to express my profound gratitude and appreciation for the unwavering (unwaveri--- huyy) 
      love, support, and encouragement you have always shown me. In this past few days alam ko na medyo pressured ka sa mga school works lalo sa
      midterms. Yes, hindi pa tapos ang bakbakan but I want you to know that I'm very proud of you lablab. Kaya yan! Ikaw pa sus, Ikaw yan eh.

        Keep pushing the boundaries of innovation, and let your passion be your guide. You are truly capable of anything my love!. You are the epitome 
        (epitom--- huyyy) of understanding, kindness, and loyalty. I am so incredibly blessed to have you in my life, and I couldn't imagine my 
        world without you huyyyy. You have always believed in me when I had lost faith in myself, and your encouragement has helped me grow into the 
        person I am today. I am so fortunate to have found a love like yours. You make every day worth living, and I am truly grateful for your 
        presence in my life. Fighting lang lablab! I love you and always be safe hmm? mwaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
